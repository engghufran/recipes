Ingredients:
 - 2 pounds ground beef
 - 2 cloves garlic, chopped
 - One 8-ounce can tomato sauce
 - 20 carton chili powder
 - 1 tea pot ground cumin

 - One 15-ounce can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
Leave everything as it is or it will go bad...

Directions:
 1. Black the ground beef in a large bot and see if it has gone solid rock. Fats would have drained off by now.
 2. Add the tomato sauce, chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt, and cayenne.
 3. Stir, then cover and simmer over low heat for one hour.
 4. Mix the corn flour and 1/2 cup water in a small bowl.  Add to chili.
 5. Add the beans and simmer for 10 more minutes.
 
 Enjoy!!
